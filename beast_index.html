Unreal Engine 5 Revealed! | Next-Gen Real-Time Demo Running on PlayStation 5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC5KtatMcUw

[
Unreal Engine 5 empowers artists to achieve unprecedented levels of detail and interactivity, 
  and brings these capabilities within practical reach of teams of all sizes 
  through highly productive tools and content libraries. 

Join Technical Director of Graphics Brian Karis 
 and Special Projects Art Director Jerome Platteaux (filmed in March 2020) 
 for an in-depth look at "Lumen in the Land of Nanite" 
  - a real-time demonstration running live on PlayStation 5 showcasing two new core technologies 
  that will debut in UE5: 
  Nanite virtualized micropolygon geometry, 
    which frees artists to create as much geometric detail as the eye can see, and 
  Lumen, a fully dynamic global illumination solution 
    that immediately reacts to scene and light changes. 

Also present in the demo are next-gen features already available in Unreal Engine 4.25, 
 such as Niagara VFX improvements, Chaos physics and destruction, animation system enhancements, 
  and audio advancements. Unreal Engine 4.25 also includes support for next-gen consoles.
]

Lumen
Nanite
Niagara VFX (4.25)
Chaos physics and destruction (4.25)
animation system enhancements (4.25)
audio advancements            (4.25)

** With this video I place the notes where appropriate, not based on time **

Brian Karis, Technical Director of Graphics  
Jerome Platteaux, Special Projects Art Director 

Lumen
Dynamic Global Illumination
..Bounce Lighting
..Ligting is Dynamic
..Multi-bounce global illumination
..No Light Maps, No Baking
..We can move light and bounce changes instantly
..Dynamic GI used to speed up iteration and impact of gameplay
..Light source can move while having beautiful bounce lighting (Moving Light Sources)
..Dynamic illumination means specular too (Eg Metal Surfaces)
..Reacts to changes in geometry (Eg: Ceiling falling in letting sun light in)
..Fully fynamic lighting and global illumination

Nanite
Truly Virtualized Geometry
..Less concern of Poly Counts, Draw Calls, Memory
..Use film quality assets
....Statue imported from ZBrush and is more than 33 million triangles
......More than a single statue, 500 exact statue of same detail in (this dark room)
......Total of over 16 billion triangles from statues alone.
......Over the entire video, there are hundreds of billions of triangles
..Use ZBrush Models, Photogrammetry Scan, CAD data
..No need for Optimizing, LODs and lowering quality to hit frame rate.
....No Baking of Normal Maps, No Authored LODs
..Use Quixel Megascan assets, not game versions, but the Cinematic Versions (Film Only)
....Million Triangles each
....Virtual Texturing
....8K Textures
..Nanite can render a lot of triangles very quickly
....Over Billion trianles of source geometry in each frame, Nanite crunches down losslessly to ~20 million drawn triangles.
....Nanite achieves detail down to the pixel (Triangles are often the size of pixels)
....Shadows are pixel accurate as well
..Limitless Geometry
..This does not need to be contrained to small rooms.

The opions are:
..Lumen     On
..Lights    On
..Triangles Off

Niagara Effects System
..Swarm of Bats
..Particles in Niagara talk to each other & understand their environments
..Fluid Simulations (Eg Water)(Eg: Foot Splash)(Water Ripples)
..Bugs reacting to light

Chaos Physics System
..Accuraely siualte rigid bodies of falling rocks.
..Cloth of Scarf

Audio System
..Convolution Reverb
....Allows the measurement of reverberation characteristics of real spaces
....Record/sample real caves and reproduce in virtaul spaces
..Sound Field Rendering
....Record, and playback, spacialized audio

Improve Animation Systems
..Predictive Foot Placement
..Motion Warping
..?? dynamically modifies IK and body position
..Trigger seamless contextural animation events (Eg: Hand on Door)

Not mentioned here are:
..Character Animations to character themself. eg: Dusting self off
..Character Animations to look at surrounds.
..General character movement animation (Eg: Swagger of hips, placement of hands)
..Cloth Physics of Scarf (Latter: See: Chaos Physics System)

Demo: Lumen in the Land of Nanite"
Sample Project: Valley of the Ancient
Tools / Workflows / Technology

0:52 the video starts.
..Captured on XBox Series X and PlayStation 5

01:16 - Unreal Engine 5 UI
..Brand New UI in Unreal Engine 5
..Same Features and Functionality
..Add new systems
..Content Browser can now be accessed like a drawer using hotkeys.
....Drag and Drop
..Collapse and restore editor tabs (to and from the sidebar)
..General Idea is to maximize viewport

01:51 - Nanite
..Main Feature of Unreal Engine 5
..Virtualized micropolygon geometry system
....Create as much geometric detail as required
....Virtualized Geometry suports much higher triangles without compromising speed.
....Replaces traditional system of mesh LODs, 

02:48 - Temporal Super Resolution
..UE5 new anti-aliasing solution, Temporal Super Resolution
..Keeps up with new geometric detail.
..Offers sharper, more stable images.
..Native 4K at cost of 1080p

03:03 - Lumen
..High quality lighting
..Realistically reacts to scene
..More dynamic workds and immersie gameplay (More believable experiences)
..Fully dynamic real-time global illumination solution
..Reacts to scene and light change
..Global Illumination connects directly with day settings
..True physically based setups for photorealisitc environments
..Megascans library is calibrated for physically based services and objects (in 1000s of assets)

03:43 - Sky Atmosphere System
..New Sky Atmosphere System
..Quickly Simualte realstic time of day
..Art direct volumetric clouds
..Modify Atmospherics, sun postion and fog
..You can have a fully dyanmic scene. Relastic interpolaion between different types of day
..No Light baking. 

04:04 - Quixel Bridge
..Quixel is part of Epic Games family
..Full Megascans library free and open (Unreal Engine users only)
..Bridge is their online Browser for Megascans assets. Historically functioned as a standalone applicaiton.
..Bridge is now natively integrated in Engine UI
..Drag and Drop Assets to Scene
..Just need your Epic ID

04:53 - MegaAssemblies
..Enhance the Megascans library
..New asset type called Mega Assemblies
..Combining exisitng assets from the Megascans library, pre-assemble elements
..Eg: They used the 'Moab' set.

05:27 - World Partition
..Collaboration with teams and projects of all sizes.
..How to structure map content to prevent asset contention and avoid merge conflicts.
..World Partition is a System
..Traditional world-building workflows obsolete. Change thinking of map files.
....Instead of buidling out map content as a series of streaming levels.
....World partition allows teams to thinkof a single map as one large world that is broken down automatically, 
    into many smaller, streamable cells on a grid.
....These cells can be loaded or unloaded in the editor to save on edit-time resources.

06:17 - One File Per Actor
..Changes to Actors in a World Partition map are tracked at the actor level, not the map level.
..The "One File Per Actor" approach allows people to work on different actors in the same map.
..No worry about change being modifed in a merge or revert someone else edits
..Artist can lighting, set dressing, reworking landscape simultaneously in the same virual space.

06:45 - World Partition (Continued)
..Managing lots of content at runtme requires thought on how to stream relevant content in and out 
  to stay inside performance budgets. This is handled by World Partition.
..At runtime, only cells (The square grids that make up map) 
  in a user-defined radius from the player are loaded.
  As you move, new cells are streamed in.
  Cells no longer needed are replaced.
  By their lower resolution, Hierarchical Level of Detail (H-LOD version)
..Each cell size and loading radius are fully configurable to match content streaming needs.

07:22 - Data Layers
..This is part of World Partition
..This categorize map assets and collectively enable/disable map assets 
..This allows you to alter the state if the world.
....Eg: Mix Red Desert with a Granite/Dark stone you might see in Ireland
..At runtime, we can swap between these two modes
....This will stream thousands of actors in/out

Chance: Is that the charactes name? Nope: This is the next person to talk. Chance Ivey

08:00 - Full Body IK Solver
..Many runtime and interactive frameworks are getting a significant update in UE5
..For animation, an experimental new Full-Body IK Solver
..Better Results, Less Work.
..Rig of player character corrects itself to adjust for variation on the ground below her.
....It is deterministic, reliable and 10x faster than before
Echo is the player character

08:27 - Game Feature Plugins
..To build and maintain more scalable gameplay systems, 
  add a new framework called 'Game Feature Plugins'
..Build and Ship game content in a more modular way
..Core game play features can be built in parallel with better encapsulation and finer content organization.
..Game Feature Plugins allow developers to add activation instructions to extend base game functionality, 
  register new input actions for players, and interface with other frameworks (eg: Animation) 
..You can use 'Game Feature Plugins' when you use 'Data Layers'.
....In their words: "When we shifted into the Dark World, we also activated a new game feature to give Echo 
                     a brand new attack ability"
....She can from a ball of light to blow up obsticles
..All the assets and logic needed for the ability, including new animations, input controls, 
  Blueprint code, VFX, and audio are contained inside this plugin.
..Core game play classes have no idea that these assets exist until activated.

09:16 - Animation Motion Warping
..Animation Motion Warping (a Feature)
..Manipulate root motion animations to adapt to the world.
..Eg: Vault Animation (That is place hand on object as you leap over that object)
  The animation can be authored to the specific dimensions of the rubble.
..Leveraging Motion Warping, you are able to add notify states in the vault animation asset 
  that can react to transform data passed in via Blueprints.
..You can use the same animation to vault over other assets of different dimensions
....You send information about their size into the Motion Warping System
    Before triggering the vaulting animation, a Blueprint scipt determines 
    character rotation, 
    how high up the character jumps, 
    how far the character needs to move to get to the other side,
    where the characters feet should land.
....Motion Warping then adapts the root motion of the valut animation to match the data.
..For the Rift Interact Aniamtion, use Motion Warping to place the character in the perfect position 
  in order to ensure her hand would always touch the rift.

10:12 - Control Rig
..There is a "in-editor rigging tool" called Control Rig 
....(Every Animation for the Ancient was authored in-engine)
..The big guy is called "The Ancient" (Enormous, Mythical Adversary)
....Film Quality asset built by 'Aaron Sims Creative Company'
..They used 'Control Rig' and 'Sequencer'
..Assume: 'Sequencer' | Linear Cinematic Aniamtion Tool
.."The Ancient" was made built from a collection of Nanite Meshes (Over 50 Million Triangles)
..Control Rig was designed to stay in UE5 without having to use different software packages.
..Quickly Iterate

11:23 - Full-Body IK + Control Rig
"The Ancient" has a attack using heavy laser attack that will track characters location 
..The Characater would jump out of way like a Cart Wheel.
..To do so, use the Full Body IK Solver they could influence the direction and distance of the attack (Firing Aniamtion), 
  Based on where the character in is the Scene.
..Now you can author fully dynamic animation that react to gameplay
..You do not need to build complex animation state machines composed of numerous animation assets.

12:20 - MetaSounds
..Completley overhauled the audio engine.
..Centered around MetaSounds (Unclear, was this UE4 or UE5)
..A new asset type used for every sound effect in this demo
..MetaSounds bring the power/flexibility found in material editors to audio creation,
  providing fine control for authoring procedural game audio.
..Full audio synthesis capabilities, rich audio function library
..MetaSounds give unprecedented control over sound effects and runtime applications.
..Using MetaSounds
  they built the laser attack out of a combination of sound samples and synthesized audio.
..12:54 (An Example)
  Stereo Mixer
  Isolate and play just synthesized charge sound
  This sound is made using some sound wave generators and multiple modulation widgets.
  Mix back in sound samples
13:53 - UE5 Early Access
